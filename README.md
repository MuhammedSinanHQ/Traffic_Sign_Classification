# 🚦 Traffic Sign Classification using Deep Learning

This project builds an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system to classify German traffic signs from images using the GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset.

The goal is to create a robust image classification pipeline covering data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
